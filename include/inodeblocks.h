     *  - \c perm must be a number in the range 0 and 0777, representing the permissions
     *  - if there are free inodes, one is used (\ref soAllocInode)
     *  - if there is no free but there are deleted inodes,
     *    the oldest deleted (\ref soUnqueueHiddenInode) 
     *    must be cleaned (\ref soFreeInodeBlocks) and used
     *  - after this operation, \ref mode must reflect the given \c type and \c perm (bitwise or)
     *  - \c owner and group are given by system calls \c getuid and \c getgid, respectively
     *  - if no inode is available, exception \c ENOSPC must be thrown.
     *
     *  \throws EINVAL if \c type is not valid.
