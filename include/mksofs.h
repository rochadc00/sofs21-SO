     *   Based on the total number of blocks of the disk (\c ntotal) and
     *   on the number of inodes (\c itotal) proposed, 
     *   computes the structural partition, that is, the actual number of inodes,
     *   the number of data blocks and the number blocks for the bitmap table,
     *   taking into account the following:
     *   - \c itotal must be rounded up to a multiple of \ref IPB
     *   - \c itotal must be lower than or equal to the rounded up value of <tt>ntotal/8</tt>
     *   - \c itotal must be lower than or equal to \ref MAX_INODES
     *   - \c itotal must be greater than or equal to \c IPB
     *   - if, at entry, the proposed value for \c itotal is 0,
     *     value <tt>ntotal/20</tt> should be used as the proposed value
     *   - for every data block, there must exist a corresponding bit in the bitmap table
     *   - after making the partition, the last block of the bitmap table can be totally used,
     *     partially used, or not used at all; in such cases, it should be assigned
     *     to the inode table
